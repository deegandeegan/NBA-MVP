# NBA MVP
 Code and files for NBA MVP voting analysis and predictions

It's important to note that basketball reference changed the way the list the NBA standings. It **no longer includes Seeds for the Eastern Conference and Western Conference**, luckily I still have an excel file of the information with Seeds. If you use the web scrapping code it will **no longer pick up the seeding because of the modification Basketball Reference made.**

The **all.csv** has the seeds though!!
